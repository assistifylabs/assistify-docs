# Creating a New Entity

## **Dashboard Page**
   When you log in, you'll see your dashboard. It's like your control center for managing Entites.

## **Start Creating**
   Look for the "Create" button on your dashboard. It's where you begin making something new.

## **Fill in Details**
   Clicking "Create" will open a small popup. In that popup, you'll write some information about what you're making.

   - **Name**: Give your new Entity a name, some easy for you to remember.
   - **Slug**: If you want, you can add a shorter name too.
   - **Platform**: Pick which way you want your new Entity to work. You have three choices: `GPT3`, `GPT4`, and `COGENERATE`.

## **Choosing How It Works**
   You can use any of these ways for free. We suggest `COGENERATE` because it's really good. But you can also pick `GPT4` if you like.

## **Finish Up**
   Once you've filled everything out, click "Create" again. This tells the computer to start making your new Entity.

##  **All Set**
   After you click, you'll get a message saying it worked. Then you can start using your new thing by clicking on it. Just remember, you can only make up to 5 Entities.
