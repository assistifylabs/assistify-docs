## Initiating a Conversation

2. You may receive more accurate and relevant answers based on the content of your documents.

Enjoy chatting with your selected AI model and leverage the power of your uploaded documents to enhance the conversation. If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance.

> [!CAUTION]
If your documents lack the data you're querying, the AI may not be able to provide a response. Our AI relies on documents as a reference for user queries.

> [!NOTE]
Please be patient as our AI is currently in beta mode. Responses may take a few seconds. We're actively working on a new version that will be significantly faster and more efficient.
